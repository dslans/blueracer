# Hyperparameters
- Batch Size
    - defines how much training data the model should work through before each update
    - in DeepRacer: how many images are used for training
    - 32, 64, 128, 256, 512
- Number of Epochs
    - How many times to loop through the batch data set before updating training weights
    - not required in DeepRacer
    - integers 3-10
- Learning Rate
    - Controls the speed at which the algorithm learns
    - Too large: prevents weights from approaching an optimal solution
    - Too small: Takes too long to arrive at minimum loss
    - Default is set to .001 in DeepRacer
- Exploration
    - Gives an option to find a balance between exploitation and exploration
    - Exploitation: makes decisions given the information it has at the time
    - Exploration: Gathers additional information beyond what’s already been collected
    - Helps to find a high reward path that may not have been discovered before
    - Default: CategoricalParameters - categorical exploration for a discrete action space
        - EpsilonGreedy - continuous action space
    - Helps prevent the neural net from being stuck in an action space
- Entropy
    - Controls the degree of randomness of an action that an agent (vehicle) may take in a given situation
    - larger: the more random actions the car will take
    - if it doesn’t take new actions it could get stuck
- Discount Factor
    - helps model decide extent to which future rewards should contribute to the overall sum of expected rewards
    - goal of RL algo is to maximize sum of rewards over the course of some time
    - discount factor can define time
    - larger: looks further into the future to consider rewards
    - smaller: agent only considers immediate rewards
    - can be set from 0 to 1
- Loss Type
    - objective function to update network weights
    - Huber loss (default): takes smaller increments compared to MSE. Use if there are convergence problems.
    - MSE loss: trains faster than Huber
- Number of Episodes
    - number of tasks your algorithm goes through in training
    - defines how many times you’ll go through loop of all tasks during training
    - values 1-1000 (default: 20)
